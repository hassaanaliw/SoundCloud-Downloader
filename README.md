SoundCloud-Downloader
=====================

An small script to download songs from SoundCloud.

Errors
----------------------
Some SoundCloud songs only provide RTMP-stream links. At the moment I am not aware of a way to download these.

An example is  [Mt.Olympus by BIG K.R.I.T](https://soundcloud.com/bigkrit/mt-olympus)

Usage
-------------------
Navigate to wherever you downloaded the script using terminal or command window.

```python SoundCloudDL.py```

And Follow the instructions.
